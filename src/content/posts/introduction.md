## Introduction

Greetings, I am Michael DeSocio. I've obtained a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from the University at Albany, State University of New York, and I am dedicated to enhancing digital security and leading the hunt on identifying threat landscapes.

### Professional Journey

Presently, I serve as an Information Technology Specialist III at the New York State Office of Information Technology Services. Currently, I work with end users and leadership to develop action plans to improve our GRC tooling. During my tenure, I have led and assisted on many initiatives including risk documentation and reporting to the NYS Executive Chamber, remediation tracking and SOP development, and process development and implementation.

Focusing on risk documentation, my responsibilities involved coordinating with leadership to determine accurate progress and representation of risks that were actively being addressed under a governor's initiaive. This effort helped to increase recognition of enterprise risks by the executive chamber by nearly 30%. This ties with the remediation tracking. As apart of this initiative, SOPs and remediation tracking were integral in allowing for these reports to be updated and passed on to executive eyes. These reports helped to increase information accuracy and asset inventory accuracy by 53% of the targeted objects.

### Volunteering and Education

During my enrollment at SUNY Albany, I was deeply involved in educational, pre-professional organizations such as the Cyber Defense Organization, aiming to nurture future cybersecurity professionals.

### Personal Interests and Homelab Shenanigans

Let's switch gears and talk about something more enjoyable! When I'm not diving into the world of cybersecurity, you'll often find me strumming my guitar or exploring nature on hiking trails. But one thing that really gets me excited is my homelab.

In my homelab setup, I utilize Proxmox, TrueNAS Scale, and Docker to provide a base layer for the services I host. A couple key platforms I have been tinkering with recently include Immich for self hosted Google Photos equivalent, Authentik for a centralized identity provider, and Plex Media Server to host my vast media collection of movies, tv shows, and ripped old fashioned cds. And to keep things interesting, I've set up active threat monitoring with Wazuh to keep an eye on potential security risks. This environment has been so helpful in ways that make it so I can experiment, learn, and challenge myself.

Whether I'm busy strengthening network security or simply enjoying some downtime with my guitar, one thing's for sure: I'm always up for an adventure, both in tech and in life.
